Project Description: The goal of this project is to use vocal data from patients with and without Parkinson's Disease (PD) to classify whether a person has or does not have PD with above an 80% accuracy.

The current way that PD is diagnosed is through a neurologist. The neurologist will make the decision that a person has PD based on their medical history and symptoms. The neurologist may also try to rule out other diseases through an MRI, blood test, and/or DaTscan. They also may try to give them a PD medication and if it helps, it will help to convince that they have PD. No specific test is available which can lead to a wrong diagnosis. By being able to diagnose PD through other methods such as a person’s vocals, the neurologist will be more accurately able to diagnose PD. As PD progresses, the muscle of the vocal cord becomes thinner and less taught and changes the person’s voice as well as their intelligibility which is a change that could hopefully be noticed in the early stages of PD to help with diagnosis.

This model would be important to both the people trying to get diagnosed as well as the doctors trying to diagnose them. This diagnosis provides the doctor with more certainty a patient has PD which can ensure they can get treated properly. If a doctor is not sure enough, they may say its something else and mistreat you allowing the disease to progress enough that delaying progression isn’t possible. This method will only be able to function as a tool like any of the other tools mentioned above to help convince a neurologist that a patient does or doesn’t have PD. Since it would be combined with other tools, it wouldn’t have for sure effect a doctors decision to diagnose a patient, so it would be unlikely to be able to be misused and false positives or false negatives wouldn’t have a definite affect. Also, when a doctor diagnoses PD, they tell their patients a percentage of uncertainty since there is no definite way to diagnose, so the uncertainty of the algorithm would be included in the diagnosis.
